Welcome to the Rails React Redux Webpacker Boilerplate!

This starter pack will get you running with a rails application that uses react and redux as a frontend in no time. All you need to do is clone the repo, cd into the directory and run two commands.

Open up two separate terminal / console tabs. In the first run these:

1. `yarn install`
2. `bin/webpack-dev-server`

In the second tab run: 

1. `bin/rails server`

That's it! You can no go to localhost:3000 to see your application.
